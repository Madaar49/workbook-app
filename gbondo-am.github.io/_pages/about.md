![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](/images/UN_SDGs.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I'm a Research Assistant at the Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, under the Engineering Geology group.

üî¨ My research interests are in application of Machine Learning and hybrid models in Geoscience domains!

üìö I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling.

üìΩÔ∏è I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## ü§ñ Geographic Information Science (GIS)
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## üìú Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## üìö Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am an affiliated researcher with the Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project and a research collaborator with the Research on International Policy Implementation Lab.

I earned my PhD in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and my BA in Political Science from Haverford College. My academic work has been published or is forthcoming in the American Political Science Review, International Studies Quarterly, Conflict Management and Peace Science, and Political Science Research and Methods, among other outlets. This research explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. I have taught quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified instructor with The Carpentries.
